# SNMP-Visualization-CAPSTONE-project-2016
This is where I will be putting the programs to try to achieve my Capstone Project.

I am trying to do a Network Administrator/Systems Engineer related project.

So I am exploring SNMP data or wireshark data.

I found the dataset at CRAWDAD.  I created an account and downloaded the data.

Now I have to finish reading their main paper describing their study and how they found significant results pertaining to their study.

Then I have to take a closer look at the data files to see what I can find significant to me.

I am thinking maybe that what I would be interested in is the occurance of errors and what kind they were and 
visualizing this occurance of errors. Since my target job is finding work keeping networks running well.
This project has already taught me more about SNMP and, of course, data scraping and visualization.
